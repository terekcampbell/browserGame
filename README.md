# browserGame
A browser and text based resource management single player, time-based progression game.

# TODO's and notes
* Keep single character for now, in the future you can find other charatcets through exploration and control them similar to colonizing new planets in Ogame
* Focus on progression of technologies in metal similar to most games, stone, bronze, iron, etc.
* Take place in an mythical world, but keep to real world science as much as possible
* Progression of collected foods, not just searching for wheat, or "food" but actually take an approach such as foraging (berries), farm (various crops), hunting?
* Similarly, I could do something similar with wood and/or stone? Perhaps not those, but different qualities of iron, wrought iron, cast iron, mild and low carbon steel, higher-carbon steels.
* I'd like the game to be educational in how things are made
* Possibly a text based storyline, I don't want any graphical portions currently
* Possibly have a form of "research"? Would be on a separate timer as actionable things and you would "ponder" different technologies until you figure out certain aspects of them
* Require the player to "ponder" multiple different aspects of a technology to fully "unlock"/understand it.
* ~~Move to VC~~
* Once the player creates an item, such as a certain quality forge, they keep that item permanantly. But in order to progress, they have to create lots of similar "stations".
* Require the player to sharpen tools at various times to maintain efficiency?
* Have items break irreparably sometimes?
