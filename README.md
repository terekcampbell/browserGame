# browserGame
A browser and text based resource management single player, time-based progression game.

# TODO's and notes
* Keep single character for now, in the future you can find other characters through exploration and control them similar to colonizing new planets in Ogame
* Focus on progression of technologies in metal similar to most games, stone, bronze, iron, etc.
* Take place in an mythical world, but keep to real world science as much as possible
* Progression of collected foods, not just searching for "food" but actually take an approach such as foraging (fruits, nuts), farm (various crops), hunting?
* Have berries go bad?
* Domestication of animals?
* Similarly, I could do something similar with wood and/or stone? Perhaps not those, but different qualities of iron, wrought iron, cast iron, mild and low carbon steel, higher-carbon steels.
* I'd like the game to be educational in how things are made
* Possibly a text based storyline, I don't want any graphical portions currently
* Possibly have a form of "research"? Would be on a separate timer as actionable things and you would "ponder" different technologies until you figure out certain aspects of them
* Require the player to "ponder" multiple different aspects of a technology to fully "unlock"/understand it.
  * After a pondering phase, you could have to practice what you thought about, which would cost resources. Likely fail at first, then ponder more, practice more, each time increasing the likelihood of unlocking the tech.
* Once the player creates an item, such as a certain quality forge, they keep that item permanantly. But in order to progress, they have to create lots of similar "stations".
* Require the player to sharpen tools at various times to maintain efficiency?
* Have items break irreparably sometimes?
* Find cave to live in at first? Make huts later on. Protection from weather? What would the purpose be? Storage of resources? Defenses from animals?
  * Minimal room for storage, minimal room for work stations.
  * Measure by sqft? separate rooms?

* ~~Move to VC~~

# Notes on tools:
Ceraunia or “thunderstones” are stones, arrowheads, stone axes, and similar artifacts, believed to have fallen from the sky when lightning struck the ground. During the middle Ages in Europe thinking about “thunderstones"  was dominated by the belief that ceraunia had magical properties and the same belief was supported by scholars. In the 11th century bishop Marbodo wrote in his poem “Liber lapidum” how ceraunia protect its owner and his house from being struck by lightning, dying at sea, losing in battles, as well as guarantees good sleep at nights.
* The player could find these thunderstones early game which would provide better tools? Or give boosts to various tasks?

Stone Stages:
The First Stage, "Implements of the Gravel Drift," contains implements that were "roughly knocked into shape."[42] His illustrations show Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools, basically Acheulean handaxes. Today they are in the Lower Palaeolithic.

The Second Stage, "Flint Flakes" are of the "simplest form" and were struck off cores.[43] Westropp differs in this definition from the modern, as Mode 2 contains flakes for scrapers and similar tools. His illustrations, however, show Modes 3 and 4, of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. His extensive lithic analysis leaves no doubt. They are, however part of Westropp's Mesolithic.

The Third Stage, "a more advanced stage" in which "flint flakes were carefully chipped into shape," produced small arrowheads from shattering a piece of flint into "a hundred pieces", selecting the most suitable and working it with a punch.[44] The illustrations show that he had microliths, or Mode 5 tools in mind. His Mesolithic is therefore partly the same as the modern.

The Fourth Stage is a part of the Neolithic that is transitional to the Fifth Stage: axes with ground edges leading to implements totally ground and polished. Westropp's agriculture is removed to the Bronze Age, while his Neolithic is pastoral. The Mesolithic is reserved to hunters.

"The Bronze Age of Britain may, therefore, be regarded as an aggregate of three stages: the first, that characterized by the flat or slightly flanged celts, and the knife-daggers ... the second, that characterized by the more heavy dagger-blades and the flanged celts and tanged spear-heads or daggers, ... and the third, by palstaves and socketed celts and the many forms of tools and weapons, ... It is in this third stage that the bronze sword and the true socketed spear-head first make their advent."

a transitional Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze

The beginning of some other technological age, such as the Industrial Age or Industrial Revolution (possibly followed by the Second Industrial Revolution, the invention of plastics, the Atomic Age, the Jet Age, the Space Age, the Digital Revolution, and the Information Age

a tool stone is a type of stone that is used to manufacture stone tools,[1] or stones used as the raw material for tools.

Possible tools:
* Mortar and Pestle
* Metate and Mano (similar to mortar and pestle, used to grind plant materiel, nuts) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mano_(stone)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metate
* Knife
* Hammer Stone and Stone Anvil for nuts. Battered and pitted stones for anvils
* Sickle
* Microlith (spear points and arrow heads)
* Spokeshave (to smooth wooden rods and shafts)
* Scraper (for hideworking or woodworking purposes)
* Adze (Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle)
* Mattock (A mattock is a versatile hand tool, used for digging and chopping, similar to the pickaxe.)
* Axe (An axe is an implement that is used to shape, split and cut wood and,  to harvest timber and as a weapon)
* An ulu is an all-purpose knife. It is utilized in applications as diverse as skinning and cleaning animals, cutting a child's hair, cutting food and, if necessary, trimming blocks of snow and ice used to build an igloo.

Research:
* Eat nuts/forage nuts (nuts don't go bad)
* Crack nuts with tool
  * Smack with rock
  * nut cracking tool (faster than cracking with rock)
*
